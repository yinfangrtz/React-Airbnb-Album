# React Airbnb Album

React App - Practice Prop

This repository contains the code for the React Airbnb Album app, which I developed by following the Scrimba tutorial. The app serves as a practical demonstration of using props in React components, specifically focusing on the Card component and its integration within the App.js file.

Happy Coding!
